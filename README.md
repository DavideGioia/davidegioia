  <h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Davide 👋</h1>
  <p align="center">
    I'm 20 yo, I live in Italy and I'm trying to become a ✨ Developer and Designer ✨. I'm a coding enthusiast so I'm trying every day to learn new technologies or languages. I love making User Interfaces cool and innovative, without affecting the experience 🌈 (UI & UX).
